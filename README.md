# todo-OOP

On my third attempt at creating a Todo App, I finally made some progress. In my first attempt, I wasn't able to finish it, and in my second attempt, I struggled to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This time, while it's not perfect, I managed to use a class and establish a separation of concerns. Instead of rendering notes directly on the DOM using JavaScript, I stored them in an array. This way, any changes to the array are reflected on the DOM. Deleting from or adding to the array leads to corresponding changes on the DOM. The biggest challenge I faced was implementing local storage and connecting the local storage array to my array of objects. Despite these challenges, I learned a lot from the experience!
